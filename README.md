  ## Installation
  Installation requirements for this application include several Node libraries - fs, inquirer, and a custom inquirer plugin called inquirer-maxlength-input-prompt. It also requires the jest dev dependency for testing purposes.

  ## Usage
  To use this application, simply open the root directory in the command line, and run the command <node index.js>. This will initialize the Inquirer prompts, which will present the user with several questions to answer in order to generate a custom SVG logo. The newly created logo will appear in a directory called 'logos' inside a file called 'logo.svg'.
